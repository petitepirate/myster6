# Broken App Issues
Not assigning the error with catch(err)
The output wasn't in with the async function, so it wouldn't register.
Nothing installed

Inconsistent (and wrong) variable declarations:
let axios = require('axios');
var app = express();

Using d and r for the .map variable names is not very descriptive of what those represent
Could use the built-in .json method from express instead of JSON.stringify
